### Hi there I'm Joe ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer specializing in modern and bespoke websites. I've been developing for over 6 years and am comfortable with a variety of languages.

My foundations began with HTML / PHP, CSS and then vanilla Javascript - I thhen naturally began to learn parts of jQuery as that was widely used at the time. Eventually I started to dabble in advanced frameworks, learning Vue & Nuxt before now making the step into React & Next.

I mainly work within projects however I sometimes post lightweight utlities or tricks I find useful and wish to help others out with too!
